Abstract
--------

A Global Network where anyone can build on their ideas or others ideas. New businesses can be quickly built using the skillsets of others on the network. We are all unique, talented individuals each with our own equally unique skillsets. But very often for us to achieve our fullest potential and develop the ideas we have into workable businesses or projects we need other skills which we do not have ourselves. With a global network of skillsets, users can build powerful teams either to offer others a powerful set of skills to assist them in achieving their goals, or to build their own ideas into successful businesses.

Entrepreneurs, Investors, PR specialists, Programmers, Designers, Artists, Electricians, Writers and just about every other talent base you can think all have a part to play in the network, anyone and everyone can be a part of DecentMind, building decentralised businesses, charities or simply powerful think groups where ideas can quickly be built into something you could only dream of alone.

Introduction
------------
 
Being one of the best in your field of expertise more often than not does not mean you will be the most successful in your field. You may have some amazing ideas and believe some of them could be highly profitable businesses, yet they remain ‘ideas’ as the task of getting any one of them off the ground is daunting.

DecentMind wants to create a Global Network of minds which enables everyone to pursue their dreams and ambitions or take part in assisting others projects. Every user on the network can build ‘Circles’ of people they trust and work well with, whether it be a ‘Circle’ for groupthink sessions or a ‘Circle’ for starting a new business venture, DecentMind disregards demographics and connects anybody in the World together with the people they need to turn an ‘idea’ into a ‘reality’.

To build out the DecentMind project, we will be using the same method to which the service we hope to offer provides. We are building a ‘Circle’ of trust and varied skills to get the project off the ground as soon as possible. 

Technologies:

C++
JAVA
